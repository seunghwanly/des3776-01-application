# Updates
- added libraries
    - `styles.xml`
    - `colors.xml`
- added animated vector
- seperated **Business Logic** from `MainActivity` event
- seperated Activities from `MainActivity`
- added data binding

# TODO
- seperate `DisplayResultActivity` into different `Fragments`
    - data binding required

    ## The reason why it needs to be seperated
    - `MainActivity`'s life cycle needs to be maintained
    - 2 different Activity life cycle don't need to be maintained
